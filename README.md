# Project Description
In this project, we have worked on the crowd counting problem. Crowd counting is
essentially generating an estimation of people in an image, which generally contains
many people hence the crowd in the name. We have worked with a single data set
that consists of two parts, that is available on Kaggle and is offered by
ShanghaiTech. Later, we have used the data augmentation method to increase
our data during training.
We have trained two different convolutional neural network models on our data,
namely CSRNet and MCNN.
We have obtained better results with CSRNet compared to MCNN. However, data
augmentation worked well for MCNN, while we cannot take the response we
expected from CSRNet models.
